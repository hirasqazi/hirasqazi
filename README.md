Bonjour Hi! 

I'm Hira, an accounting student at the John Molson School of Business, Concordia University.

My academic journey revolves around the intricate world of numbers, but my passion extends beyond balance sheets and income statements. I find joy in unraveling the stories hidden within data through captivating visualizations. Whether it's crunching numbers, investigating diverse datasets, or uncovering insights, I'm all in.

This portfolio is to showcase my analytical and technical skills and learn from like-minded indiviusals.
